# STSTEM DESIGN UBER/OLA

**1. APIs:**
- Authentication API
- User Management API
- Ride Booking API
- Driver Management API
- Ride History API
- Payment API
- Rate Limiting.

**2. Frontend:**
- To scale the frontend, using a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute static assets globally and reduce latency.
- Caching techniques to cache frequently accessed data and reduce the load on the backend.

**3. Backend:**
- Building a microservices architecture to divide the system into smaller, loosely coupled services that can be independently scaled.
- Load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers for horizontal scaling.
- Auto-scaling based on traffic patterns, using AWS services like Amazon EC2 and S3.

**4. Database:**

- Making a distributed database system to handle scalability and high availability.
- Read replicas and sharding techniques to distribute the read workload across multiple database instances.
- Implement caching mechanisms like Redis or Amazon ElastiCache to cache frequently accessed data and reduce database load.
- Regularly backup data and implement disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity.
